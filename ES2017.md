## Async Function

The `async function` declaration defines an asynchronous function, which returns an AsyncFunction object. An asynchronous function is a function which operates asynchronously via the event loop, using an implicit Promise to return its result.

```js
// Will return a Promise that resolves to true.
async function main () {
  return true
}

main()
```

## Await Operator

The `await` operator is used to wait for a Promise. It can only be used inside an `async function`.

```js
function resolveAfter2Seconds(x) { 
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(x);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function f1() {
  var x = await resolveAfter2Seconds(10);
  console.log(x); // 10
}

f1();
```
